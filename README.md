# QT Support

Makefiles for apps that use qmake.

Support exists for QT GUI and non-QT command line apps.

These files get included from other makefiles after TARGETS, SRCS, ..., etc. get defined.

See the 'argv' project for a usage example.

Includes installation targets and groff/manfile generation targets.
